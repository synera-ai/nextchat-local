# Code Directory Project Integration Rules

## Code-Project Synchronization

### Project Document Updates
- Always update relevant project documents when modifying app code
- Reference project file paths in commit messages when possible
- Validate changes against project acceptance criteria

### File Change Tracking
- Document all file changes in project progress logs
- Include file paths and brief description of changes
- Maintain chronological record of modifications

### Acceptance Criteria Validation
- Verify changes meet project acceptance criteria
- Test against project requirements before marking tasks complete
- Document validation results in progress log

### Code Quality Alignment
- Follow project implementation guidelines
- Maintain consistency with project architectural decisions
- Apply project-specific coding standards

## Project Context Integration

### Before Making Changes
- Read full project context from relevant project document
- Understand current stage and assigned tasks
- Check for blockers or dependencies

### During Development
- Work within project scope and constraints
- Follow project technical requirements
- Document decisions that affect project direction

### After Changes
- Update project progress log with changes made
- Mark completed tasks in project document
- Identify any new blockers or dependencies

## Handoff Preparation

### Context Documentation
- Document current state of code changes
- Include file locations and modification details
- Note any important considerations or warnings

### Next Steps Clarity
- Clearly define next immediate actions
- Identify dependencies for next tasks
- Provide context for receiving agent

## Integration with Project System

### Status Reporting
- Include code-specific metrics in status reports
- Track files changed, tests added, and functionality implemented
- Report on acceptance criteria progress

### Blocker Identification
- Identify code-related blockers promptly
- Document technical dependencies and constraints
- Escalate architectural decisions to project level

### Quality Assurance
- Ensure code changes align with project goals
- Validate against project success criteria
- Maintain project timeline and milestone tracking
