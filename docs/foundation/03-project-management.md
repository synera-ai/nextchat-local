# üë• Project Management

NextChat uses a **document-driven project management system** where all work is tracked through project documents and structured metadata.

## Project Lifecycle

Every project follows this lifecycle:

```
idea ‚Üí plan ‚Üí design ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí testing ‚Üí review ‚Üí deployment ‚Üí completion
```

## Project Stages

| Stage | Duration | Focus | Output |
|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| **Idea** | Quick | Concept exploration | Project concept |
| **Plan** | 1-2 days | Detailed planning | Requirements & roadmap |
| **Design** | 1-3 days | Technical design | Architecture & specs |
| **Implementation** | 2-4 weeks | Active development | Code & features |
| **Testing** | 1-2 weeks | QA & validation | Test results |
| **Review** | 1 day | Code review | Approved changes |
| **Deployment** | 1 day | Release & deploy | Live system |
| **Completion** | 1 day | Wrap-up & learnings | Documentation |

## Project Types

### Feature Projects
**Build new user-facing functionality**
- Example: "Plugin Marketplace"
- Duration: 2-4 weeks
- Deliverable: New feature available to users

### Foundation Projects
**Build infrastructure & systems**
- Example: "Design System Establishment"
- Duration: 3-6 weeks
- Deliverable: Infrastructure component

### Analysis Projects
**Study codebase & provide recommendations**
- Example: "Themes & Layouts Architecture Analysis"
- Duration: 1-3 days
- Deliverable: Analysis report with recommendations

### Documentation Projects
**Create or improve documentation**
- Example: "Documentation System v1.0.0"
- Duration: 1-2 weeks
- Deliverable: Documentation structure & content

### Refactoring Projects
**Improve existing code quality**
- Example: "Component Library Modularization"
- Duration: 2-4 weeks
- Deliverable: Refactored, cleaner code

## Project Organization

### Project Files
- **Location**: `/docs/projects/`
- **Structure**: Version-controlled markdown files
- **Naming**: `{type}-{name}-v{major}.{minor}.{patch}.md`
- **Example**: `feature-plugin-marketplace-v1.0.0.md`

### Project Metadata

Each project includes:
```yaml
projectId: unique-identifier
title: "Full Project Title"
stage: plan          # Current stage
priority: high       # Priority level
tags: [tag1, tag2]   # Searchable tags
version: 1.0.0       # Semantic version
```

### Project Sections

Every project document includes:

1. **Metadata** - Version, priority, dates
2. **Human Context** - Why the project matters
3. **AI Agent Context** - What AI should do
4. **Current Stage** - Detailed stage info
5. **Progress Log** - Commit history
6. **Decisions** - Key decisions made
7. **Blockers** - Issues blocking progress
8. **Analysis** - Findings & results
9. **Implementation** - How to build it
10. **Success Metrics** - How to measure success

## Commit Integration

Every commit should reference a project:

```bash
git commit -m "type(project): description [v1.0.0]"

Examples:
  feat(plugin-marketplace): Add plugin search [v1.0.0]
  refactor(components): Modularize Button component [v1.0.1]
  docs(api): Add API endpoint documentation [v1.0.0]
  fix(chat): Resolve message ordering bug [v1.0.1]
```

## Active Projects

**Current Active Projects** (~25)

### Ready To Start
- Documentation System (Phase 1)
- User Authentication Feature
- Basic Project System Implementation

### In Progress
- Core Architecture Modernization
- MCP Plugins Unification Analysis
- Design System Establishment

### Blocked (Waiting for Dependencies)
- Component Library (waits for Core Architecture)
- Testing System (waits for Documentation)
- Deployment System (waits for Core Architecture)

## Contributing

### How to Propose a Project
1. Check existing projects in `/docs/projects/`
2. If similar project exists, join it
3. If new project needed:
   - Copy appropriate template
   - Fill in all sections
   - Add to `/docs/projects/active/`
   - Submit for review

### How to Work on a Project
1. Find project in `/docs/projects/active/`
2. Read the "AI Agent Context" section
3. Start the first pending task
4. Update progress log as you work
5. Commit with proper message format
6. Update project status

### How to Complete a Project
1. Mark all tasks as complete
2. Update final progress log entry
3. Move project to `/docs/projects/completed/`
4. Make final commit: `project complete: {name}`

## Project Versioning

NextChat uses **semantic versioning**:

```
v{major}.{minor}.{patch}

- Major: Breaking changes or major milestones
- Minor: New features or enhancements
- Patch: Bug fixes and small improvements

Examples:
  v1.0.0 - Initial release
  v1.0.1 - Bug fix
  v1.1.0 - New feature
  v2.0.0 - Major overhaul
```

## Status Reporting

After each project phase, a status report is generated:

```
**Status Report**
- Project: {name} [v{version}]
- Stage: {current-stage}
- Files Changed: {count} files
- Tasks: {completed}/{total}
- Blockers: {count} active
- Commits: {count} this phase
- Next: {next-immediate-action}
```

## Communication

### Status Channels
- **Commit Messages**: Immediate updates
- **Project Documents**: Complete history
- **Progress Logs**: Weekly summaries
- **Status Reports**: Phase completion

### Questions & Blockers
- Add to project "Blockers" section
- Notify team if blocking other projects
- Update status log
- Escalate if critical

## Best Practices

‚úÖ **Do**
- Commit frequently (at least once per day)
- Update progress logs after each milestone
- Ask for help when blocked
- Document decisions in project file
- Cross-reference related projects

‚ùå **Don't**
- Work on projects not in active list
- Commit without project reference
- Abandon projects mid-way
- Work on multiple projects simultaneously
- Forget to update status

## Resources

- **Project Templates**: `/docs/projects/templates/`
- **Completed Projects**: `/docs/projects/completed/`
- **Project Ideas**: `/docs/projects/ideas/`
- **Project Guide**: Full guide in `index.md`
