# Human-in-the-Loop System Design

## Overview

The Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) system provides strategic decision points and approval gates within the project management workflow. This system ensures human oversight for critical decisions while maintaining development velocity through automated workflows.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Checkpoints
Strategic decision points where human input is required before proceeding.

### 2. Approval Workflows
Structured processes for human review and approval of automated actions.

### 3. Escalation Procedures
Automatic escalation paths when automated systems encounter issues.

### 4. Bypass Mechanisms
Emergency procedures for critical situations requiring immediate action.

## System Architecture
