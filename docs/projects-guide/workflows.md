# Common Workflows

## Feature Development Workflow

### 1. Project Creation
```
User: "I need to add user authentication"
AI: "This looks like a significant feature. Should we start a new project for this?"
User: "Yes"
AI: [Creates project document, fills out initial sections]
```

### 2. Planning Phase
- Define problem statement and business value
- Identify technical requirements and dependencies
- Create initial task breakdown
- Set acceptance criteria

### 3. Implementation Phase
- Work through tasks systematically
- Update progress log after each session
- Document decisions as they're made
- Track blockers and dependencies

### 4. Testing and Review
- Validate against acceptance criteria
- Complete testing requirements
- Document lessons learned
- Prepare for deployment

### 5. Completion
- Move to completed folder
- Update cross-references
- Archive project document

## Bug Fix Workflow

### 1. Issue Identification
```
User: "The login form isn't validating emails properly"
AI: "I'll check for existing authentication projects first..."
AI: [Finds existing project, works within context]
```

### 2. Root Cause Analysis
- Document the bug in project blockers section
- Identify affected files and components
- Determine fix approach

### 3. Implementation
- Create fix within project context
- Update progress log
- Test fix thoroughly

### 4. Validation
- Verify fix resolves issue
- Check for regression
- Update acceptance criteria

## Refactoring Workflow

### 1. Scope Definition
```
User: "I want to refactor the API layer"
AI: "This is a significant refactoring. Should we start a new project?"
User: "Yes, but check if there's an existing API project first"
AI: [Checks existing projects, creates new refactoring project]
```

### 2. Impact Analysis
- Document current architecture
- Identify refactoring goals
- Plan migration strategy
- Set rollback criteria

### 3. Incremental Refactoring
- Work in small, testable increments
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Update progress regularly
- Document architectural decisions

### 4. Validation and Cleanup
- Verify functionality preserved
- Update documentation
- Remove deprecated code
- Complete project

## Multi-Agent Collaboration Workflow

### 1. Initial Agent Setup
```
Agent A: [Starts project, completes initial planning]
Agent A: [Documents handoff context]
Agent A: "Ready for handoff to implementation agent"
```

### 2. Handoff Process
```
Agent B: [Reads project document and handoff notes]
Agent B: [Continues implementation work]
Agent B: [Updates progress log]
```

### 3. Context Switching
- Each agent documents their work
- Handoff notes include current state
- Next steps clearly defined
- Important warnings included

### 4. Coordination
- Regular status updates
- Blocker communication
- Decision documentation
- Progress synchronization

## Documentation Project Workflow

### 1. Documentation Planning
```
User: "I need to document the API endpoints"
AI: "Should we start a new documentation project?"
User: "Yes"
AI: [Creates documentation project with appropriate template]
```

### 2. Content Creation
- Identify documentation scope
- Create content structure
- Write documentation sections
- Include examples and references

### 3. Review and Validation
- Check completeness against requirements
- Validate technical accuracy
- Ensure consistency with codebase
- Get stakeholder review

### 4. Publication
- Deploy documentation
- Update cross-references
- Archive project
- Monitor for updates needed

## Emergency Fix Workflow

### 1. Rapid Response
```
User: "Critical bug in production, need immediate fix"
AI: "I'll work within existing project context for rapid response"
AI: [Identifies relevant project, documents emergency fix]
```

### 2. Minimal Documentation
- Document fix in progress log
- Note emergency context
- Focus on immediate resolution
- Plan follow-up documentation

### 3. Post-Emergency
- Complete proper documentation
- Update project with lessons learned
- Review process improvements
- Archive emergency response

## Integration Project Workflow

### 1. Integration Planning
```
User: "Need to integrate with new payment provider"
AI: "This is a significant integration. Should we start a new project?"
User: "Yes"
AI: [Creates integration project with external dependency tracking]
```

### 2. External Coordination
- Document external dependencies
- Track third-party requirements
- Plan integration timeline
- Set up communication channels

### 3. Implementation
- Work with external constraints
- Handle API changes and updates
- Implement error handling
- Test integration thoroughly

### 4. Deployment and Monitoring
- Deploy with monitoring
- Track integration health
- Document operational procedures
- Complete project with monitoring plan

## Workflow Best Practices

### Project Selection
- Use appropriate template for project type
- Consider project scope and complexity
- Plan for dependencies and blockers
- Set realistic timelines

### Progress Tracking
- Update progress logs regularly
- Document decisions as they're made
- Track blockers and dependencies
- Maintain accurate status information

### Quality Assurance
- Validate against acceptance criteria
- Test thoroughly before completion
- Document lessons learned
- Plan for maintenance and updates

### Communication
- Use clear, concise language
- Provide specific next steps
- Document important warnings
- Maintain context across handoffs
