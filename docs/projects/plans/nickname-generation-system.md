# Nickname Generation System Design

## Overview
A system to automatically generate fun, applicable, and unique nicknames for all projects in the project management system.

## Core Requirements
1. **Fun & Applicable**: Nicknames should be memorable and relate to the project
2. **Unique**: Globally unique across all projects
3. **Phonetically Unique**: Different pronunciation within daily context
4. **Brief**: Short and easy to remember
5. **User Override**: Allow simple user prompts to change nicknames

## Nickname Generation Algorithm

### Pattern-Based Generation
Nicknames follow these patterns based on project type and content:

#### Project Type Patterns
- **feature**: `{adjective}-{noun}` (e.g., "Swift-Fox", "Bright-Star")
- **refactor**: `{verb}-{noun}` (e.g., "Polish-Gem", "Tune-Engine")
- **bugfix**: `{adjective}-{tool}` (e.g., "Sharp-Sword", "Quick-Fix")
- **documentation**: `{adjective}-{knowledge}` (e.g., "Wise-Owl", "Clear-Guide")
- **infrastructure**: `{adjective}-{structure}` (e.g., "Solid-Foundation", "Strong-Bridge")

#### Content-Based Generation
Extract key terms from project title/description and create combinations:
- **Technology**: "React" → "Rocket", "API" → "Arrow", "Database" → "Diamond"
- **Function**: "Authentication" → "Guardian", "Payment" → "Treasure", "Search" → "Hunter"
- **Domain**: "User" → "Pilot", "Admin" → "Captain", "System" → "Engine"

### Uniqueness Validation

#### Global Uniqueness
- Maintain registry of all existing nicknames
- Check against existing nicknames before assignment
- Regenerate if conflict detected

#### Phonetic Uniqueness
Use phonetic similarity detection:
- **Similar sounds**: "Swift" vs "Shift" (too similar)
- **Rhyming**: "Bright-Star" vs "Light-Car" (too similar)
- **Consonant clusters**: "Quick-Fix" vs "Thick-Six" (too similar)

#### Daily Context Uniqueness
- Track nicknames used in current day
- Ensure no two active projects have phonetically similar nicknames
- Allow similar nicknames across different days

### Generation Process

1. **Extract Project Context**
   - Project type (feature, refactor, etc.)
   - Key terms from title/description
   - Technology stack
   - Domain area

2. **Generate Candidate Nicknames**
   - Apply type-based patterns
   - Apply content-based transformations
   - Create 5-10 candidate options

3. **Validate Uniqueness**
   - Check global uniqueness
   - Check phonetic uniqueness
   - Check daily context uniqueness

4. **Select Best Option**
   - Prefer shorter nicknames
   - Prefer more memorable combinations
   - Prefer stronger project relevance

5. **Store and Register**
   - Store nickname in project metadata
   - Register in global nickname registry
   - Update daily context tracker

## User Override System

### Simple Prompt Recognition
Users can request nickname changes with simple prompts:
- "Call it [nickname]"
- "Rename to [nickname]"
- "I prefer [nickname]"
- "Change nickname to [nickname]"

### Confirmation Process
1. **Validate Request**: Check if requested nickname is valid
2. **Check Uniqueness**: Ensure requested nickname is unique
3. **Confirm Change**: Ask user to confirm the change
4. **Update System**: Update project and registry if confirmed

### Fallback Options
If user request conflicts with uniqueness:
- Suggest similar alternatives
- Offer to generate new options
- Explain uniqueness constraints

## Implementation Details

### Nickname Registry
```json
{
  "globalNicknames": {
    "swift-fox": "feature-user-auth-v1.0.0",
    "polish-gem": "refactor-mcp-market-v2.1.0",
    "sharp-sword": "bugfix-login-flow-v1.0.1"
  },
  "dailyContext": {
    "2025-01-15": ["swift-fox", "polish-gem", "sharp-sword"]
  },
  "phoneticMap": {
    "swift": ["shift", "swift", "gift"],
    "fox": ["box", "fox", "locks"]
  }
}
```

### Nickname Patterns
```json
{
  "patterns": {
    "feature": ["{adjective}-{noun}", "{noun}-{verb}"],
    "refactor": ["{verb}-{noun}", "{adjective}-{tool}"],
    "bugfix": ["{adjective}-{tool}", "{verb}-{fix}"],
    "documentation": ["{adjective}-{knowledge}", "{noun}-{guide}"],
    "infrastructure": ["{adjective}-{structure}", "{noun}-{foundation}"]
  },
  "wordLists": {
    "adjectives": ["swift", "bright", "sharp", "quick", "solid", "clear", "wise", "strong"],
    "nouns": ["fox", "star", "gem", "engine", "sword", "fix", "owl", "guide"],
    "verbs": ["polish", "tune", "build", "craft", "forge", "shape", "mold", "create"],
    "tools": ["sword", "hammer", "key", "lock", "bridge", "ladder", "compass", "map"],
    "knowledge": ["owl", "sage", "guide", "book", "scroll", "wisdom", "light", "beacon"],
    "structures": ["foundation", "bridge", "tower", "wall", "gate", "pillar", "beam", "arch"]
  }
}
```

### Content Transformations
```json
{
  "transformations": {
    "technology": {
      "react": "rocket",
      "api": "arrow",
      "database": "diamond",
      "auth": "guardian",
      "payment": "treasure",
      "search": "hunter"
    },
    "function": {
      "authentication": "guardian",
      "payment": "treasure",
      "search": "hunter",
      "admin": "captain",
      "user": "pilot",
      "system": "engine"
    }
  }
}
```

## Quality Assurance

### Nickname Quality Criteria
- **Memorability**: Easy to remember and recall
- **Relevance**: Clearly relates to project purpose
- **Brevity**: Short and concise (2-3 syllables total)
- **Uniqueness**: Globally and phonetically unique
- **Fun Factor**: Engaging and enjoyable to use

### Validation Rules
- Minimum 2 words, maximum 3 words
- Total length: 4-12 characters
- No special characters except hyphens
- No numbers or technical jargon
- Must be pronounceable in English

### Testing Strategy
- Generate nicknames for sample projects
- Validate uniqueness constraints
- Test phonetic similarity detection
- Verify user override functionality
- Check daily context tracking

## Integration Points

### Project Schema Integration

- Add `nicknameHistory` for tracking changes
- Add `nicknameGenerated` timestamp

### Agent Rules Integration

- **Seasonal Variations**: Different nickname styles by season
- **Team Preferences**: Learn from team nickname preferences
- **Multi-language Support**: Generate nicknames in different languages

### Analytics
