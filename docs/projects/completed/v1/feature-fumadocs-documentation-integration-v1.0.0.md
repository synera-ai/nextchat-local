## Human Context

### Problem Statement
The current documentation system lacks modern tooling and integration with the existing React Router hash-based routing architecture. We need to implement a modern documentation system that integrates seamlessly with our existing design system and project management infrastructure. The implementation follows a **duplication strategy** where the original `./docs/` directory remains the source of truth, while the new documentation system provides a modern interface for accessing all content.

### Business Value
- **Modern Documentation**: Leverage React Router and modern React components
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized routing and component loading
- **Design System Integration**: Seamless integration with existing theme system
- **Project Management Integration**: Connect with existing project management system
- **Developer Experience**: Better TypeScript support and modern tooling
- **Complete Content Access**: All documentation files accessible through modern interface
- **Source of Truth Preservation**: Original `./docs/` directory remains authoritative
- **Unified System**: Single documentation system integrated with main application

## Duplication Strategy Implementation

### Content Duplication Strategy
The Fumadocs integration must follow a complete duplication strategy:

1. **Source of Truth Preservation**
   - Original `./docs/` directory (117+ files) remains authoritative
   - All content changes made to original files first
   - `./content/docs/` serves as Fumadocs system with complete duplication

2. **File-by-File Duplication Process**
   - Duplicate each Markdown file to MDX in `./content/docs/`
   - Add appropriate frontmatter metadata
   - Update internal links and references
   - Preserve original content in `./docs/`

3. **Asset Duplication Process**
   - Duplicate all 26+ image files from `./docs/images/` to `./content/docs/images/`
   - Preserve image organization and structure
   - Update image references in documentation

4. **Synchronization Process**
   - Keep both directories in sync
   - Original `./docs/` remains source of truth
   - `./content/docs/` serves Fumadocs system
   - Process files by category (foundation, developers, etc.)

5. **Navigation Integration**
   - Update meta.json to include all duplicated content
   - Create complete navigation structure
   - Add cross-references for all content
   - Validate all navigation links

### Duplication Metrics
- **Total Files to Duplicate**: 117 markdown + 26 images = 143 files
- **Currently Duplicated**: ~31 MDX files + 26 images = 57 files (39.9% complete)
- **Remaining Files**: ~86 markdown files still need duplication
- **Critical Content**: All essential documentation must be duplicated
