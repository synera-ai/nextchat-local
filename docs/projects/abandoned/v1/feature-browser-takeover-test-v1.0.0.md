## Testing Guidelines for AI Agent

### ✅ DO

- Test thoroughly and methodically
- Document issues with clear reproduction steps
- Take screenshots of visual problems
- Check browser console for errors
- Test across multiple breakpoints
- Use keyboard navigation extensively
- Test with real user workflows
- Request clarification from user if needed
- Try edge cases and unusual interactions
- Verify persistence of changes

### ❌ DON'T

- Make code changes (report issues only)
- Assume things work without testing
- Skip responsive testing
- Skip accessibility testing
- Rush through scenarios
- Test only happy paths
- Ignore console errors
- Forget to test on mobile
- Miss focus indicator testing
- Assume single-browser compatibility

## Guidance for Agent Interaction

### When to Request User Input

Ask the user about:
- Expected behavior for unclear interactions
- Business logic (is this the intended flow?)
- Design intent (should this look this way?)
- Priority assessment (how critical is this issue?)
- Reproduction difficulty (can you reproduce this?)

### Example Interaction Patterns

**Agent**: "I found that clicking tab 3 and then Tab+Shift doesn't return focus to tab 2. Is this expected keyboard behavior?"

**User**: "No, Shift+Tab should move to the previous tab. This is a bug."

**Agent**: "Documented as High priority in keyboard navigation. Moving to responsive testing phase. Shall I continue?"

## Browser Tools & Features Available

- **DevTools**: F12 or Cmd+Opt+I
- **Device Emulation**: Chrome DevTools
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Built-in
- **Accessibility Inspector**: Chrome DevTools
- **Performance Tab**: For animation smoothness
- **Console**: For error detection
- **Network Tab**: For timing issues
- **Application Tab**: For storage testing

## Current Status

## Progress Log

- **2025-10-16** - **AI Agent**: Created browser takeover testing project plan
  - Stage: plan
  - Created: Comprehensive testing methodology
  - Defined: 5 testing phases + scenarios
  - Setup: Issue tracking template
  - Time Spent: 0.5 hours

## Decisions

- **DECISION-001**: Interactive Testing Over Automated
  - **Rationale**: Interactive testing catches real-world UX issues that automation misses
  - **Impact**: More thorough but requires agent engagement
  - **Alternatives**: Pure automation, manual QA only
  - **Made By**: Project Planning

- **DECISION-002**: Structured Scenario Approach
  - **Rationale**: Prevents missing areas while allowing flexibility for discovery
  - **Impact**: Systematic coverage with room for exploration
  - **Alternatives**: Free-form exploration only
  - **Made By**: Project Planning

## Blockers

None identified at planning stage.
