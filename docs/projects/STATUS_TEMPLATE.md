# Status Report Template

## Standard Status Report Format

Use this template for all status reports after code-changing responses:

```
**Status Report**
- Project: [project name or "New Project Suggested"]
- Stage: [current stage: idea/plan/design/implementation/testing/review/deployment/completion]
- Files Changed: [count] files
- Tasks: [completed]/[total]
- Blockers: [count] active
- Next: [next immediate action]
```

## Status Report Components

### Project Identification
- **Project Name**: Current project name or indication of new project suggestion
- **Stage**: Current lifecycle stage from project document
- **Files Changed**: Count of files modified in current session

### Progress Metrics
- **Tasks**: Ratio of completed to total tasks in current stage
- **Blockers**: Count of active blockers preventing progress
- **Next Action**: Specific next step to be taken

## Examples

### Active Project Status
```
**Status Report**
- Project: user-authentication-feature
- Stage: implementation
- Files Changed: 3 files
- Tasks: 4/7
- Blockers: 1 active
- Next: Complete JWT middleware implementation
```

### New Project Suggestion
```
**Status Report**
- Project: New Project Suggested
- Stage: idea
- Files Changed: 2 files
- Tasks: 0/0
- Blockers: 0 active
- Next: Create project document for theme-system-redesign
```

### Completed Work
```
**Status Report**
- Project: api-optimization
- Stage: testing
- Files Changed: 5 files
- Tasks: 6/6
- Blockers: 0 active
- Next: Move to review stage and prepare deployment
```

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use
- After every response that involves code changes
- When switching between projects or contexts
- At the end of work sessions
- When providing progress updates

### Content Requirements
- Keep bullet points concise and specific
- Use exact project names from documents
- Include specific next actions, not general statements
- Update counts accurately

### Integration
- Reference project documents when available
- Update project progress logs with status information
- Maintain consistency with project stage definitions
