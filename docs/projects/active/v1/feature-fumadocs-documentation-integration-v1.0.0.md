## Human Context

### Problem Statement
The current documentation system lacks modern tooling and integration with the existing Next.js App Router architecture. We need to implement Fumadocs to provide a modern, performant documentation system that integrates seamlessly with our existing design system and project management infrastructure.

### Business Value
- **Modern Documentation**: Leverage Next.js App Router and React Server Components
- **Performance Optimization**: 40-60% faster page loads with RSC
- **Design System Integration**: Seamless integration with existing theme system
- **Project Management Integration**: Connect with existing project management system
- **Developer Experience**: Better TypeScript support and modern tooling

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Fumadocs successfully integrated with Next.js App Router
- [ ] Design system integration working seamlessly
- [ ] Project management system integration functional
- [ ] Documentation structure migrated and accessible
- [ ] Performance improvements measurable
- [ ] All existing documentation accessible through new system

### Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing documentation
- Must integrate with existing design system and themes
- Must work with existing project management system
- Must use relative paths throughout (workspace rule compliance)
- Must follow document-driven architecture principles

### Stakeholders
- **Development Team**: Need modern documentation tooling
- **AI Agents**: Need better documentation access and integration
- **Project Managers**: Need integrated project documentation
- **System Architects**: Need maintainable, scalable documentation system

## AI Agent Context

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Install and configure Fumadocs packages
- [ ] Set up Next.js App Router integration
- [ ] Integrate with existing design system
- [ ] Create documentation routing structure
- [ ] Implement project management system integration
- [ ] Set up content collections for documentation
- [ ] Configure search and navigation
- [ ] Implement theme integration
- [ ] Set up automated documentation generation

### Dependencies
- **Next.js App Router** (type: infrastructure)
  - Status: available
  - Description: Next.js 14 with App Router already configured
- **Design System** (type: codebase)
  - Status: available
  - Description: Existing design system in `./app/design-system/`
- **Project Management System** (type: documentation)
  - Status: available
  - Description: Project management system in `./docs/projects/`
- **Existing Documentation** (type: documentation)
  - Status: available
  - Description: Documentation structure in `./docs/`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Fumadocs packages installed and configured
- [ ] App Router integration working
- [ ] Design system integration functional
- [ ] Documentation routing working
- [ ] Project management integration working
- [ ] All documentation accessible
- [ ] Performance improvements achieved
- [ ] Relative paths used throughout
- [ ] Document-driven architecture maintained

### Implementation Guidelines
- Use relative paths for all file references
- Follow existing project management patterns
- Maintain document-driven architecture
- Integrate with existing design system
- Ensure high performance and low latency
- Follow workspace rules strictly
- Use semantic versioning for project phases

### File References
- **File Path**: `./app/` - Next.js application code
- **File Path**: `./docs/` - Existing documentation structure
- **File Path**: `./app/design-system/` - Design system components
- **File Path**: `./docs/projects/` - Project management system
- **File Path**: `./package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
