## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

#### 1. SSO Integration Complexity (HIGH RISK)
**Risk**: Complex integration with multiple identity providers
**Mitigation**:
- Use proven SSO libraries and frameworks
- Implement comprehensive testing for each provider
- Create fallback authentication mechanisms
- Provide detailed integration documentation

#### 2. Encryption Key Management (HIGH RISK)
**Risk**: Key loss or compromise leading to data exposure
**Mitigation**:
- Use cloud-based key management services
- Implement key escrow and recovery procedures
- Add key usage monitoring and alerting
- Create comprehensive key management documentation

#### 3. Compliance Implementation (HIGH RISK)
**Risk**: Failure to meet compliance requirements
**Mitigation**:
- Engage compliance experts and auditors
- Implement comprehensive compliance monitoring
- Create detailed compliance documentation
- Regular compliance assessments and reviews

### Medium-Risk Areas

#### 1. Security Monitoring Complexity (MEDIUM RISK)
**Risk**: Complex security monitoring setup and maintenance
**Mitigation**:
- Use managed security services where possible
- Implement automated monitoring configuration
- Create comprehensive monitoring documentation
- Regular monitoring system health checks

#### 2. User Adoption of Security Features (MEDIUM RISK)
**Risk**: Users may resist additional security measures
**Mitigation**:
- Implement gradual rollout of security features
- Provide comprehensive user training and support
- Create user-friendly security interfaces
- Regular user feedback collection and improvement
