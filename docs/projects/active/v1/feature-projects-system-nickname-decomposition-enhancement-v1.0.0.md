# Project: Projects System Nickname & Decomposition Enhancement

## Metadata
- **Project ID**: projects-system-nickname-decomposition-enhancement
- **Title**: Enhance Projects System with Nicknames and Decomposition Capabilities
- **Stage**: plan
- **Created Date**: 2025-01-15
- **Last Updated**: 2025-01-15
- **Priority**: high
- **Tags**: ["system-enhancement", "project-management", "automation", "agent-tools"]

## Human Context

### Problem Statement
The current project management system lacks personalization and parallel work capabilities. Projects are identified only by technical names, making them less memorable and harder to reference in conversations. Additionally, there's no systematic way to identify when large projects can be broken into smaller, parallel work streams.

### Business Value
- **Improved Agent Efficiency**: Nicknames make projects more memorable and easier to reference
- **Parallel Development**: Decomposition capabilities enable multiple agents to work simultaneously
- **Better Project Management**: Fun, applicable nicknames improve project engagement and tracking
- **Scalability**: System can handle larger, more complex projects through decomposition

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Every project automatically gets a unique, fun, applicable nickname
- [ ] Nicknames are phonetically unique within daily context
- [ ] Users can request nickname changes with simple prompts
- [ ] System can identify when projects can be decomposed
- [ ] Agents can create parallel work streams from decomposed projects
- [ ] All changes maintain simplicity for agent rule following

### Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing projects
- Keep agent rules simple and easy to follow
- Ensure nickname uniqueness across all projects
- Preserve existing project management workflows

## AI Agent Context

### Technical Requirements
1. **Nickname System**:
   - Auto-generate fun, applicable nicknames for all projects
   - Ensure uniqueness across all projects (global uniqueness)
   - Ensure phonetic uniqueness within daily context
   - Allow user-initiated nickname changes with confirmation
   - Store nickname in project metadata

2. **Project Decomposition**:
   - Analyze project scope to identify decomposition opportunities
   - Create parallel work streams for independent tasks
   - Maintain project relationships and dependencies
   - Enable "whomever picks it up first" parallel work model

3. **Schema Updates**:
   - Add nickname field to project schema
   - Add decomposition-related fields
   - Maintain backward compatibility

### Dependencies
- [ ] Current project schema (`.project-schema.json`)
- [ ] Existing project management rules
- [ ] Project templates and documentation

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Schema includes nickname field with validation
- [ ] Nickname generation algorithm creates unique, fun names
- [ ] Decomposition detection identifies parallel work opportunities
- [ ] Agent rules updated to handle nicknames and decomposition
- [ ] All existing projects can be migrated to new system
- [ ] Documentation updated with new capabilities

### Implementation Guidelines
- Use simple, memorable nickname patterns
- Ensure phonetic uniqueness using common pronunciation rules
- Create clear decomposition criteria and guidelines
- Maintain existing project lifecycle and commit integration
- Keep agent rules concise and actionable
