## Decisions

- **2025-10-16** - **Component Architecture**: Enhanced existing docs-page component instead of creating separate components
  - **Rationale**: Maintains backward compatibility and keeps all documentation logic centralized
  - **Impact**: Single source of truth for documentation features
  - **Alternatives**: Create separate components for search, TOC, etc. (chose consolidation)
  - **Made By**: AI Agent

- **2025-10-16** - **Search Implementation**: Implemented client-side full-text search
  - **Rationale**: No backend dependency, instant results, better performance
  - **Impact**: Works entirely in browser, no network latency
  - **Alternatives**: Server-side search with API (chose client-side for performance)
  - **Made By**: AI Agent

- **2025-10-16** - **TOC Generation**: Auto-generate from markdown headings
  - **Rationale**: No manual maintenance needed, always in sync with content
  - **Impact**: Reduces maintenance burden and ensures accuracy
  - **Alternatives**: Manual TOC specification (chose automatic)
  - **Made By**: AI Agent
