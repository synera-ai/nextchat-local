## Human Context

### Problem Statement
The current documentation system at `/#/docs` has a functional React Router-based implementation but lacks visual polish, intuitive navigation, and modern UX patterns. The interface needs refinement to provide users with a more engaging and intuitive documentation browsing experience with better visual hierarchy, improved navigation, and enhanced accessibility.

### Business Value
- **User Engagement**: More polished interface encourages documentation exploration

- **Developer Experience**: Better documentation UI improves developer adoption
- **Retention**: Intuitive interfaces reduce cognitive load and increase satisfaction

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Documentation page has improved visual hierarchy and branding
- [ ] Navigation is intuitive with clear section organization
- [ ] Search functionality is prominent and easy to use
- [ ] Mobile/responsive design is fully optimized
- [ ] All accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) are met
- [ ] Load time and performance metrics improved
- [ ] Code organization follows design system standards
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified
- [ ] User testing validates improved usability

### Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing routing (`/#/docs`)
- Must preserve original `./docs/` directory as source of truth
- Must use existing design system tokens and CSS variables
- Must follow workspace rules for relative paths
