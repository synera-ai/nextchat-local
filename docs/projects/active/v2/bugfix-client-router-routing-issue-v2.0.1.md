## Project Overview

**Issue**: The application is experiencing 404 errors due to a routing conflict between React Router (HashRouter) and Next.js App Router. The `ClientRouter` component was added as a workaround but is causing the main application to fail to load.

## Problem Statement

### Root Cause
- `ClientRouter.tsx` uses `HashRouter` from `react-router-dom` (REMOVED)
- **DEEPER ISSUE**: `home.tsx` still uses React Router components (`Route`, `Routes`, `useLocation`)
- Next.js App Router expects its own routing system
- This creates a fundamental conflict causing 404 errors on all routes
- The main application fails to load at `http://localhost:3000`

### Impact
- **Critical**: Main application completely inaccessible
- **Blocking**: Cannot test PageContainer system (v2.1.0 project)
- **User Experience**: Complete application failure

## Current Status

### Stage: active

### Description
üî¥ **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

The `ClientRouter` component is causing a fundamental routing conflict that prevents the application from loading. This is blocking all testing and development work.

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **URGENT**: Fix routing conflict to restore application functionality
2. **CRITICAL**: Ensure main app loads at `http://localhost:3000`
3. **BLOCKING**: Must resolve before continuing v2.1.0 testing

## Technical Analysis

### Current Implementation (BROKEN)
```typescript
// home.tsx - STILL USING REACT ROUTER
import {
  Route,
  Routes,
  useLocation,
} from "react-router-dom"; // ‚ùå Conflicts with Next.js routing

// Inside Screen component:
<Routes>
  <Route path={Path.Home} element={<Chat />} />
  <Route path={Path.Settings} element={<Settings />} />
  // ... more React Router routes
</Routes>
```

### Expected Implementation (NEXT.JS)
```typescript
// Should use Next.js routing instead of React Router
// Next.js App Router handles routing automatically
// No custom router wrapper needed
```

### File Dependencies
- `./app/components/home.tsx` - Uses ClientRouter (line 286)
- `./app/components/ClientRouter.tsx` - Contains problematic HashRouter
- `./app/page.tsx` - Entry point that renders Home component

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Remove ClientRouter (RECOMMENDED)
- **Approach**: Remove ClientRouter wrapper entirely
- **Rationale**: Next.js App Router should handle routing automatically
- **Risk**: Low - Next.js routing is the standard approach
- **Effort**: Minimal - just remove the wrapper

### Option 2: Fix ClientRouter Implementation
- **Approach**: Implement proper Next.js-compatible router
- **Rationale**: Keep the wrapper but make it compatible
- **Risk**: Medium - more complex implementation
- **Effort**: Higher - need to understand why wrapper was added

### Option 3: Investigate Original Issue
- **Approach**: Find why ClientRouter was added in first place
- **Rationale**: Address root cause of routing issues
- **Risk**: Low - understanding the problem
- **Effort**: Medium - investigation required

## Recommended Solution

**Option 1: Remove ClientRouter**

### Implementation Steps
1. Remove `ClientRouter` import from `home.tsx`
2. Remove `<ClientRouter>` wrapper from JSX
3. Delete `ClientRouter.tsx` file
4. Test that application loads correctly
5. Verify all routes work with Next.js routing

### Expected Outcome
- Application loads at `http://localhost:3000`
- All routes accessible via Next.js App Router
- No 404 errors
- Can proceed with v2.1.0 testing

## Testing Plan

### Pre-Fix Testing
- [ ] Confirm 404 error on `http://localhost:3000`
- [ ] Verify ClientRouter is causing the issue
- [ ] Document current broken state

### Post-Fix Testing
- [ ] Application loads successfully at `http://localhost:3000`
- [ ] All main routes accessible (Settings, Masks, etc.)
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] PageContainer system works (for v2.1.0)

## Progress Log

- **2025-10-16** - **claude-3.5-sonnet**: Identified routing conflict issue
  - Stage: active
  - Files Changed: [bugfix-client-router-routing-issue-v2.0.1.md]
  - Issue: ClientRouter using HashRouter conflicts with Next.js routing
  - Impact: Complete application failure, blocking v2.1.0 testing

## Blockers

- **BLOCKER-001**: Application routing completely broken
  - Status: open
  - Priority: CRITICAL
  - Assigned To: claude-3.5-sonnet
  - Created: 2025-10-16
  - Impact: Cannot test any functionality, blocking all development

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Remove ClientRouter to restore application functionality
2. **URGENT**: Test that main app loads correctly
3. **CRITICAL**: Verify all routes work with Next.js routing
4. **BLOCKING**: Resume v2.1.0 PageContainer testing once app loads
