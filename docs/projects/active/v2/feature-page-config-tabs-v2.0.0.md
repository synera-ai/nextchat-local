## Project Overview

**v2.0.0 Restructuring**: This project was reorganized to properly account for actual completion state and missing integration work. The page configuration system infrastructure (Phases 1-2 in v1) is production-ready. This version focuses on COMPLETING the actual integration and migration work that was not done in v1.

## Project Goals (v2.0.0 - COMPLETE INTEGRATION)

- Complete cleanup of Tabs component for dual-mode support
- Migrate settings.tsx to use PageContainer
- Verify all settings functionality preserved
- Migrate second page as integration example (Masks)
- Perform comprehensive integration testing
- Document complete migration patterns

## Success Criteria (v2.0.0)

- [x] Tabs component cleaned up and refactored (dual-mode support)
- [ ] settings.tsx fully migrated to PageContainer
- [ ] All settings tabs render correctly (General, Chat, API, Sync, Danger)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works end-to-end
- [ ] A11y compliance verified
- [ ] Masks page migrated as second example
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Migration documentation complete

## Current Status

### Stage: active

### Description
üîÑ **PHASE RESTRUCTURE & ACTIVE MIGRATION**

The v1.0.0 project infrastructure is complete and production-ready. This v2.0.0 version focuses on actual integration work:
- Infrastructure (Phases 1-2 from v1): ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Migration & Integration (New Phases 1-4 in v2): ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS

### Phase Structure (v2.0.0)

The project has been restructured to reflect ACTUAL work remaining:

- **v1.0.0 Infrastructure** (Completed): Type system, validation, factories, documentation, tests
- **v2.0.0 Migration** (New): Integration, refactoring, migration patterns

## Phase 1: Tabs Component Cleanup (v2.0.0)

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Deliverables**:
- [x] Tabs component refactored to dual-mode (controlled + uncontrolled)

- [x] Backwards compatible (settings.tsx still works with defaultTab)
- [x] Type safety verified
- [x] Code quality checks passing (ESLint 100%, Prettier formatted)
- [x] Git commits with proper messages [v2.0.0]

**Technical Approach**:
```typescript
// Dual-mode support using nullish coalescing
const activeTab = controlledActiveTab ?? internalActiveTab;

// Mode 1: Uncontrolled (existing code)
<Tabs tabs={[...]} defaultTab="general" />

// Mode 2: Controlled (new code)
<Tabs tabs={[...]} activeTab={activeTab} onChange={setActiveTab} />
```

**Commits**:
- refactor(tabs): Support dual mode - controlled + uncontrolled [v2.0.0]

## Phase 2 Status Update - Reopened for Debugging

### Initial Migration Attempt - Issues Found

**What Was Attempted:**
- Replaced Tabs component with PageContainer in settings.tsx
- Created dynamic configuration using factory functions
- Passed all required props to sub-components

**What Went Wrong:**
- ‚ùå Browser page went blank after migration
- ‚ùå No error messages visible
- ‚ùå PageContainer component may have integration issues
- ‚ùå Component prop passing not working correctly

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. PageContainer component may not properly pass props to content components
2. Configuration structure mismatch between factory format and component expectations
3. Missing error boundaries/logging for debugging
4. Context provider integration issues

**Decision:**
- Reverted changes (commit: bde7f63c)
- Taking safer incremental approach
- Will validate PageContainer in isolation first

### Revised Phase 2 Approach

**New Substeps:**
1. Test original settings page (verify working state)
2. Create minimal PageContainer test page
3. Debug component prop passing
4. Create reusable migration pattern
5. Apply proven pattern to settings.tsx

**Benefits:**
‚úÖ Validates PageContainer before full migration
‚úÖ Finds issues with smaller test scope
‚úÖ Reduces risk to production code
‚úÖ Creates documented, reusable patterns
‚úÖ Builds confidence incrementally

### Timeline Adjustment
- Expected completion: Pushing to tomorrow
- Additional validation needed
- Better testing approach ensures success

## Testing Requirements & Reminders

### CRITICAL: Vigorous Testing Policy for v2.0.0

**Lesson Learned:** 
Phase 2 Task 1 was coded but not tested properly, resulting in blank page. Future phases MUST have explicit testing before marking tasks complete.

### Testing Checkpoint System

**RULE: No task is complete until tested. Encode this in checklist.**

#### Phase 1 Testing Checkpoint ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Tabs component compiles without errors
- [x] TypeScript types are correct
- [x] ESLint 100% passing
- [x] Prettier formatting correct
- [x] Git commit format correct
- [x] Dual-mode functionality works (controlled & uncontrolled)
- [x] Backwards compatibility verified
- [x] Code review: logic sound

#### Phase 2 Testing Checkpoints (MUST VERIFY BEFORE MARKING COMPLETE)

**Pre-Browser Testing:**
- [ ] Code compiles without errors (npm run build)
- [ ] TypeScript types are correct (no type errors)
- [ ] ESLint 100% passing (no lint errors)
- [ ] Prettier formatting correct
- [ ] Git commit format correct [v2.0.0]
- [ ] Import paths are relative (no absolute paths)
- [ ] All React hooks rules followed (ESLint rules-of-hooks)

**Browser Testing (MANDATORY):**
- [ ] Navigate to localhost:3001 successfully
- [ ] Settings page loads without blank screen
- [ ] All 5 tabs render:
  - [ ] General tab shows content
  - [ ] Chat tab shows content
  - [ ] Models & APIs tab shows content
  - [ ] Sync & Storage tab shows content
  - [ ] Danger Zone tab shows content
- [ ] Tab switching works (click each tab, content changes)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works:
  - [ ] Arrow Right/Left switches tabs
  - [ ] Home key goes to first tab
  - [ ] End key goes to last tab
- [ ] No console errors (F12 dev tools)
- [ ] No console warnings related to React
- [ ] No TypeScript errors in browser dev tools
- [ ] Page performance is good (no lag on tab switching)

**Accessibility Testing:**
- [ ] Tab buttons are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Tab focus indicator visible
- [ ] ARIA attributes present and correct
- [ ] Screen reader navigation works (if available)

**Regression Testing:**
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] No breaking changes to other pages
- [ ] Settings state is properly saved/restored
- [ ] No changes to file structure

**Screenshot Verification:**
- [ ] Take screenshot of each tab working
- [ ] Save screenshots to documentation
- [ ] Document expected vs actual behavior

### Testing Methodology

**For Each Phase:**

1. **Code Quality First** (automated)
   ```bash
   npm run build     # Must succeed
   npm run lint      # Must pass
   npm run format    # Must pass
   git diff          # Must show expected changes
   ```

2. **Browser Testing Second** (manual)
   - Start dev server
   - Test in fresh incognito window
   - Take screenshots
   - Check console for errors
   - Test all user interactions

3. **Document Results** (required)
   - Update project file with test results
   - Include screenshots
   - Note any issues found
   - Only then mark task complete

### Test Failure Protocol

**If Any Test Fails:**

1. ‚ùå DO NOT mark task as complete
2. ‚ùå DO NOT commit changes yet
3. ‚úÖ Revert changes if necessary
4. ‚úÖ Document issue in project file
5. ‚úÖ Create sub-task for debugging
6. ‚úÖ Update Phase 2 approach section
7. ‚úÖ Try again with different approach

### Example Test Session Format

### Critical Reminders for Future Work

üî¥ **BEFORE COMMITTING CODE:**
- [ ] I tested this in the browser
- [ ] All tabs render correctly
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works
- [ ] I took screenshots to verify
- [ ] I documented test results

üî¥ **BEFORE MARKING TASK COMPLETE:**
- [ ] All automated tests passed
- [ ] All browser tests passed
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] All screenshots captured
- [ ] Test results documented in project file
- [ ] No issues will surprise user later

üî¥ **IF PAGE IS BLANK:**
- [ ] Do NOT assume it will work
- [ ] Do NOT just try again
- [ ] Revert immediately
- [ ] Document the issue
- [ ] Use safer approach next time

### Success Criteria for Phase 2 Final Validation

Phase 2 is ONLY complete when:
1. ‚úÖ All 4 tasks have completed their test checklists
2. ‚úÖ Settings page works identically to original (or better)
3. ‚úÖ All 5 tabs render with proper content
4. ‚úÖ No console errors or warnings
5. ‚úÖ Keyboard navigation fully functional
6. ‚úÖ A11y compliance verified
7. ‚úÖ Performance is acceptable
8. ‚úÖ All test results documented
9. ‚úÖ Screenshots included in project docs
10. ‚úÖ Git commits properly formatted [v2.0.0]

### Testing Tools Available

- Browser Dev Tools (F12)
- Screenshot tool in terminal
- ESLint/Prettier for code quality
- npm run build for compilation
- Git for tracking changes
- Project documentation for recording results

### Remember

**Testing is not optional. Testing is not "nice to have."**

A blank page in production is a complete failure. 

Vigorous testing prevents that.

**Every task must be tested before completion.**

## CRITICAL: Browser Testing Environment Rules

### Port 3000 MANDATORY

**RULE: Testing MUST ALWAYS be on localhost:3000**

This is NON-NEGOTIABLE because:
- User has control of port 3000 exclusively
- Port 3001 is auto-fallback (not controlled)
- Testing on wrong port gives invalid results
- Results on 3001 may not match production on 3000

### Before Starting Browser Tests

```bash
# STEP 1: Kill any process on 3001
lsof -i :3001 | grep -v COMMAND | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true

# STEP 2: Ensure port 3000 is available
lsof -i :3000 | grep -v COMMAND | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true

# STEP 3: Start dev server
npm run dev

# STEP 4: Wait for "Ready on localhost:3000"

# STEP 5: Navigate browser to http://localhost:3000
```

### Port Verification Checklist

- [ ] Dev server output shows "localhost:3000" (not 3001)
- [ ] Browser URL bar shows "localhost:3000"
- [ ] Verify with: curl http://localhost:3000 | head -5
- [ ] If you see port 3001, STOP and restart dev server

### What NOT To Do

‚ùå Do NOT test on localhost:3001
‚ùå Do NOT assume 3001 and 3000 are equivalent
‚ùå Do NOT skip port verification
‚ùå Do NOT continue if on wrong port

### Why This Matters

Port 3000 is where the user accesses the app. If it works on 3001 but not 3000, 
the testing was invalid and wasted time. Always test on the production port.
