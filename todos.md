# ***IGNORE THIS OUTDATED FILE***

## Add a projects management concept
Generate a comprehensive plan to provide developers with a Document-driven architecture for managing projects from idea to implementation using the cursor coding agent and working exclusively within a new directory at /docs/projects.

### DONE

## Setup workspace rules
Plan to strictly enforce the docs/project system for all of our conversations in this workspace.

- Plan to create a .cursorrules file and any required documentation in the root of the workspace and any child folders where all coding agents will get triggered to follow the rules at all times.
- You'll need to auto-suggest things like "should we start a new project for this?" or "would you like to tackle the backlog next?"
- Your responses to me must always be very minimal, but should always include a basic "status report" when you're providing updates.
- Create and manage a list of simple, short-typed prompts I can give you that will triggger various aspects of the projects process.
- I need you to provide a human-friendly document that describes how the system works both visually and descriptively.

### DONE

## Unify/Understand MCP + Plugins
