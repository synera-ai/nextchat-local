# Frequently Asked Questions

## How to Get Help Quickly?

1. Ask ChatGPT / Bing / Baidu / Google, etc.
2. Ask online users. Please provide background information about the problem and a detailed description of the problem encountered. High-quality questions make it easier to get useful answers.

# Deployment Related Questions

For detailed tutorials on various deployment methods, please refer to: https://rptzik3toh.feishu.cn/docx/XtrdduHwXoSCGIxeFLlcEPsdn8b

## Why does the Docker deployment version keep prompting for updates?

The Docker version is equivalent to the stable version. The latest Docker is always consistent with the latest release version. Currently, our release frequency is once every one to two days, so the Docker version will always lag behind the latest commit by one to two days, which is expected.

## How to deploy on Vercel

1. Register a Github account and fork this project
2. Register Vercel (mobile phone verification required, you can use a Chinese number) and connect your Github account
3. Create a new project on Vercel, select the project you forked on Github, fill in environment variables as needed, and start deployment. After deployment, you can access your project through the domain provided by Vercel under the condition of having a ladder.
4. If you need to access without walls in China: Add a CNAME record for your domain name on your domain management website, pointing to cname.vercel-dns.com. Then set up your domain access on Vercel.

## How to modify Vercel environment variables

- Go to the Vercel console page;
- Select your NextChat project;
- Click the Settings option at the top of the page;
- Find the Environment Variables option in the sidebar;
- Modify the corresponding values as needed.

## What is the environment variable CODE? Must it be set?

This is your custom access password. You can choose:

1. Don't set it, delete the environment variable. Caution: At this time, anyone can access your project.
2. When deploying the project, set the environment variable CODE (supports multiple passwords separated by commas). After setting the access password, users need to enter the access password in the settings interface before they can use it. See [related instructions](/docs/https://github.com/Yidadaa/ChatGPT-Next-Web/blob/main/README_CN.md#%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE%E9%A1%B5%E9%9D%A2%E8%AE%BF%E9%97%AE%E5%AF%86%E7%A0%81)

## Why doesn't my deployed version have streaming responses?

> Related discussion: [#386](https://github.com/Yidadaa/ChatGPT-Next-Web/issues/386)

If you use nginx reverse proxy, you need to add the following code to the configuration file:

```
# No caching, support streaming output
proxy_cache off;  # Turn off caching
proxy_buffering off;  # Turn off proxy buffering
chunked_transfer_encoding on;  # Enable chunked transfer encoding
tcp_nopush on;  # Enable TCP NOPUSH option, disable Nagle algorithm
tcp_nodelay on;  # Enable TCP NODELAY option, disable delayed ACK algorithm
keepalive_timeout 300;  # Set keep-alive timeout to 65 seconds
```

If you are deploying on Netlify, this issue is still waiting to be resolved, please be patient.

## I deployed it, but I can't access it

Please check and exclude the following issues:

- Is the service started?
- Is the port mapped correctly?
- Is the firewall port open?
- Is the route to the server passable?
- Is the domain name resolved correctly?

## What is a proxy and how to use it?

Due to OpenAI's IP restrictions, China and some other countries/regions cannot directly connect to the OpenAI API and need to go through a proxy. You can use a proxy server (forward proxy) or a pre-configured OpenAI API reverse proxy.

- Forward proxy example: Scientific internet ladder. In the case of docker deployment, set the environment variable HTTP_PROXY to your proxy address (for example: 10.10.10.10:8002).
- Reverse proxy example: You can use someone else's proxy address or set it up for free through Cloudflare. Set the project environment variable BASE_URL to your proxy address.

## Can domestic servers be deployed?

Yes, but there are problems to be solved:

- Need a proxy to connect to github and openAI and other websites;
- Domestic servers need to be filed for domain name resolution;
- Domestic policies restrict proxy access to external networks/ChatGPT related applications and may be blocked.

## Why do network errors occur after docker deployment?

For details, see discussion: https://github.com/Yidadaa/ChatGPT-Next-Web/issues/1569

# Usage Related Questions

## Why does it keep prompting "An error occurred, please try again later"

There may be many reasons, please check in order:

- Please first check if your code version is the latest version, update to the latest version and try again;
- Please check if the api key is set correctly, the environment variable name must be all uppercase with underscores;
- Please check if the api key is available;
- If you still cannot determine the problem after the above steps, please submit a new issue in the issue area and attach the vercel runtime log or docker runtime log.

## Why does ChatGPT's reply become garbled?

In the settings interface - model settings, there is an item called `temperature`. If this value is greater than 1, it may cause garbled replies. Adjust it back to within 1.

## When using, it prompts "Now in an unauthorized state, please enter the access password in the settings page"?

The project has set an access password through the environment variable CODE. When using it for the first time, you need to go to the settings and enter the access code before you can use it.

## When using, it prompts "You exceeded your current quota, ..."

There's a problem with the API KEY. Insufficient balance.

## When using, I encounter "Error: Loading CSS chunk xxx failed..."

To reduce the first screen white screen time, chunked compilation is enabled by default. The technical principle is as follows:

- https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/lazy-loading
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55993890/how-can-i-disable-chunkcode-splitting-with-webpack4
- https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/38507
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55993890/how-can-i-disable-chunkcode-splitting-with-webpack4

However, NextJS has poor compatibility and may cause this error on older browsers. You can disable chunked compilation during compilation.

For the Vercel platform, add `DISABLE_CHUNK=1` to the environment variables and redeploy;
For self-compiled deployment projects, use `DISABLE_CHUNK=1 yarn build` during build;
For Docker users, since Docker has already been built when packaging, disabling this feature is not currently supported.

Note that after disabling this feature, users will load all resources when visiting the website for the first time. If the user's network condition is poor, it may cause a long white screen, thus affecting the user experience, so consider this yourself.

## When using, I encounter "NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node': The node...."
Please turn off the browser's own automatic translation function and turn off all automatic translation plugins.

# Network Service Related Questions

## What is Cloudflare?

Cloudflare (CF) is a network service provider that provides CDN, domain management, static page hosting, edge computing function deployment, etc. Common uses: purchase and/or host your domain name (resolution, dynamic domain name, etc.), put a CDN on your server (can hide IP from being blocked), deploy websites (CF Pages). CF provides most services for free.

## What is Vercel?

Vercel is a global cloud platform designed to help developers build and deploy modern web applications faster. This project and many web applications can be deployed on Vercel for free with one click. No need to understand code, no need to understand linux, no need for servers, no need to pay, no need to set up OpenAI API proxy. The disadvantage is that you need to bind a domain name to access it without walls in China.

## How to get a domain name?

1. Register yourself at a domain name supplier. Foreign ones include Namesilo (supports Alipay), Cloudflare, etc., domestic ones include Wanwang, etc.;
2. Free domain name suppliers: eu.org (second-level domain name), etc.;
3. Ask a friend for a free second-level domain name.

## How to get a server

- Foreign server suppliers: Amazon Cloud, Google Cloud, Vultr, Bandwagon, Hostdare, etc.;
  Foreign server matters: Server lines affect domestic access speed, CN2 GIA and CN2 line servers are recommended. If the server is difficult to access in China (severe packet loss, etc.), you can try putting a CDN (Cloudflare and other suppliers).
- Domestic server suppliers: Alibaba Cloud, Tencent, etc.;
  Domestic server matters: Domain name resolution requires filing; domestic server bandwidth is more expensive; accessing foreign websites (Github, openAI, etc.) requires a proxy.

## Under what circumstances does a server need to be filed?

Websites operating in mainland China need to be filed according to regulatory requirements. In practice, if the server is located in China and has domain name resolution, the server supplier will implement regulatory filing requirements, otherwise the service will be shut down. The usual rules are as follows:

| Server Location | Domain Name Supplier | Whether Filing is Required |
|---|---|---|
| Domestic | Domestic | Yes |
| Domestic | Foreign | Yes |
| Foreign | Foreign | No |
| Foreign | Domestic | Usually No |

After changing server suppliers, you need to transfer the filing.

# OpenAI Related Questions

## How to register an OpenAI account?

Go to chat.openai.com to register. You need:

- A good ladder (OpenAI supports regional native IP addresses)
- A supported email (such as Gmail or company/school email, not Outlook or qq email)
- A way to receive SMS authentication (such as SMS-activate website)

## How to enable OpenAI API? How to query API balance?

Official website address (ladder required): https://platform.openai.com/account/usage
Some netizens have built balance query proxies without ladders, please ask netizens to get them. Please identify whether the source is reliable to avoid API Key leakage.

## Why doesn't my newly registered OpenAI account have API balance?

(Updated April 6) Newly registered accounts usually display API balance after 24 hours. Currently, newly registered accounts are given $5 balance.

## How to recharge OpenAI API?

OpenAI only accepts credit cards from specified regions (Chinese credit cards cannot be used). Some ways include:

1. Depay virtual credit card
2. Apply for a foreign credit card
3. Find someone online to recharge for you

## How to use GPT-4 API access?

- GPT-4 API access requires a separate application. Go to the following address to fill in your information to enter the application queue waitlist (prepare your OpenAI organization ID): https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api
  Then wait for email messages.
- Enabling ChatGPT Plus does not mean having GPT-4 permissions, the two are completely unrelated.

## How to use Azure OpenAI interface

Please refer to: [#371](https://github.com/Yidadaa/ChatGPT-Next-Web/issues/371)

## Why is my Token being consumed so quickly?

> Related discussion: [#518](https://github.com/Yidadaa/ChatGPT-Next-Web/issues/518)

- If you have GPT 4 permissions and are using GPT 4 api daily, then because GPT 4 price is about 15 times that of GPT 3.5, your bill amount will rapidly expand;
- If you are using GPT 3.5 and the usage frequency is not high, but you still find your bill amount increasing rapidly, then please immediately troubleshoot according to the following steps:
  - Go to the openai official website to check your api key consumption records. If your token is consumed every hour and consumes tens of thousands of tokens each time, then your key must be leaked. Please delete and regenerate immediately. **Don't check balance on messy websites.**
  - If your password is set very short, such as letters within 5 digits, then the blasting cost is very low. It is recommended that you search the docker log records to confirm whether someone has tried a large number of password combinations. Keyword: got access code
- Through the above two methods, you can locate the reason why your token is being consumed quickly:
  - If the openai consumption record is abnormal but the docker log has no problems, then it means the api key is leaked;
  - If the docker log finds a large number of got access code blasting records, then the password has been blasted.

## How is the API billed?

OpenAI website billing instructions: https://openai.com/pricing#language-models  
OpenAI charges based on the number of tokens. 1000 tokens usually represent 750 English words or 500 Chinese characters. Input (Prompt) and output (Completion) are billed separately.  

| Model | User Input (Prompt) Billing | Model Output (Completion) Billing | Maximum Tokens per Interaction |
|----|----|----|----|
| gpt-3.5-turbo | $0.0015 / 1 thousand tokens | $0.002 / 1 thousand tokens | 4096 |
| gpt-3.5-turbo-16K | $0.003 / 1 thousand tokens | $0.004 / 1 thousand tokens | 16384 |
| gpt-4 | $0.03 / 1 thousand tokens | $0.06 / 1 thousand tokens | 8192 |
| gpt-4-32K | $0.06 / 1 thousand tokens | $0.12 / 1 thousand tokens | 32768 |

## What's the difference between gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt3.5-turbo-0301 (or gpt3.5-turbo-mmdd) models?

Official documentation: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5

- gpt-3.5-turbo is the latest model and will be continuously updated.
- gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 is a model snapshot frozen on March 1st, will not change, and is expected to be replaced by a new snapshot in 3 months.
