## Prompt Usage Examples

### Starting a New Feature
```
User: "I need to implement user profiles"
AI: "This looks like a significant feature. Should we start a new project for this?"
User: "project new"
AI: [Creates project document, guides through setup]
```

### Checking Current Work
```
User: "project status"
AI: "Current project: user-profiles (stage: design, 2/5 tasks complete, 0 blockers). Next: Complete UI mockups."
```

### Resuming Interrupted Work
```
User: "project continue"
AI: "Resuming: user-profiles project. Current stage: implementation. Next task: Create profile API endpoints."
```

### Documenting a Decision
```
User: "project decide"
AI: "What decision would you like to document?"
User: "We're using PostgreSQL for user data storage"
AI: [Documents decision with rationale and alternatives]
```

### Handling a Blocker
```
User: "project block"
AI: "What blocker would you like to document?"
User: "Waiting for design approval from stakeholder"
AI: [Documents blocker with priority and impact]
```

### Getting Help
```
User: "guide show"
AI: [Displays guide index with navigation links]
```

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Multi-Project Management

AI: [Checks document completeness]
User: "status report"
AI: [Provides detailed status with all metrics]
```

### Context Switching
```
User: "project handoff"
AI: [Prepares handoff notes for context switch]
User: [Switches to different agent or context]
New Agent: [Reads handoff notes and continues work]
```

## Prompt Response Format

### Standard Response Structure
- **Immediate action** - What the AI is doing
- **Context information** - Relevant project details
- **Next steps** - What happens next
- **Status report** - Current project status (when applicable)

### Error Handling
- **Missing context** - AI requests clarification
- **Invalid prompt** - AI suggests correct usage
- **System issues** - AI provides troubleshooting guidance

## Best Practices

### When to Use Prompts
- **Start of work sessions** - Use `project continue` or `project status`
- **After significant changes** - Use `project progress` or `status report`
- **When stuck** - Use `project block` to document issues
- **Making decisions** - Use `project decide` to record choices
- **Switching contexts** - Use `project handoff` for smooth transitions

### Prompt Efficiency
- **Be specific** - Use exact prompt phrases
- **Provide context** - Give additional details when needed
- **Follow up** - Use related prompts for complete workflows
- **Stay organized** - Use prompts to maintain project structure
