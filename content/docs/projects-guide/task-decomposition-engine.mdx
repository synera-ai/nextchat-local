# Task Decomposition Engine Design

## Overview

The Task Decomposition Engine automatically breaks down high-level projects into atomic, trackable tasks. This system uses AI-powered analysis to identify dependencies, estimate effort, and create actionable work items that can be executed in parallel.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Atomic Tasks
Smallest unit of work that can be completed independently and tested.

### 2. Dependency Graph
Visual representation of task relationships and execution order.

### 3. Effort Estimation
AI-powered estimation of time and complexity for each task.

### 4. Parallel Execution
Identification of tasks that can be executed simultaneously.

## System Architecture

### Task Decomposition Process

#### 1. Project Analysis
- **Input**: Project description, requirements, constraints
- **Process**: AI analysis of project scope and complexity
- **Output**: High-level task breakdown

#### 2. Task Identification
- **Input**: Project analysis results
- **Process**: Identification of atomic tasks
- **Output**: List of potential tasks

#### 3. Dependency Mapping
- **Input**: Task list and project context
- **Process**: Analysis of task relationships
- **Output**: Dependency graph

#### 4. Effort Estimation
- **Input**: Task descriptions and historical data
- **Process**: AI-powered effort estimation
- **Output**: Time and complexity estimates

#### 5. Parallelization Analysis
- **Input**: Dependency graph and estimates
- **Process**: Identification of parallel execution opportunities
- **Output**: Execution plan with parallel tracks

### Task Types

#### 1. Code Tasks
- **Scope**: Implementation of specific functionality
- **Criteria**: 
  - Single responsibility
  - Testable unit
  - Clear acceptance criteria
- **Examples**: 
  - "Implement user authentication API endpoint"
  - "Create user registration form component"
  - "Add password validation logic"

#### 2. Documentation Tasks
- **Scope**: Creation or update of documentation
- **Criteria**:
  - Specific documentation target
  - Clear content requirements
  - Reviewable deliverable
- **Examples**:
  - "Document API authentication flow"
  - "Update user manual with new features"
  - "Create deployment guide"

#### 3. Configuration Tasks
- **Scope**: Setup or modification of configuration
- **Criteria**:
  - Specific configuration target
  - Clear requirements
  - Testable outcome
- **Examples**:
  - "Configure database connection settings"
  - "Set up CI/CD pipeline for new environment"
  - "Update environment variables"

#### 4. Testing Tasks
- **Scope**: Creation or execution of tests
- **Criteria**:
  - Specific test target
  - Clear test criteria
  - Measurable outcome
- **Examples**:
  - "Write unit tests for authentication service"
  - "Create integration tests for user flow"
  - "Perform security testing on API endpoints"

#### 5. Review Tasks

### Dependency Types

#### 1. Hard Dependencies
- **Description**: Tasks that must be completed before another can start
- **Examples**:

- **Handling**: Sequential execution required

#### 2. Soft Dependencies
- **Description**: Tasks that benefit from completion of others but can proceed independently
- **Examples**:
  - Documentation can be written while implementation is in progress
  - Testing can begin with mock data before real implementation
- **Handling**: Parallel execution with coordination

#### 3. Resource Dependencies
- **Description**: Tasks that require specific resources or expertise
- **Examples**:
  - Database tasks require database administrator
  - Security tasks require security expert
- **Handling**: Resource allocation and scheduling

#### 4. External Dependencies
- **Description**: Tasks that depend on external systems or services
- **Examples**:
  - Integration with third-party API
  - Deployment to external infrastructure
- **Handling**: External coordination and monitoring

### Effort Estimation

#### 1. Complexity Analysis
- **Factors**:
  - Code complexity (cyclomatic complexity)
  - Integration complexity
  - Testing complexity
  - Documentation requirements

- **Output**: Optimal resource allocation
- **Benefit**: Maximize parallel execution within resource constraints

#### 3. Risk Assessment
- **Process**: Analysis of parallel execution risks
- **Output**: Risk mitigation strategies
- **Benefit**: Reduce coordination overhead and conflicts
