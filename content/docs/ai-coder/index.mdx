# AI Coder Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation system designed specifically for AI coders working with document-driven architecture and project management systems.

## Overview

This documentation system provides AI-optimized guides, examples, and best practices for managing development projects through a structured, document-driven approach. It's designed to help AI agents understand and effectively work with complex codebases while maintaining high standards of code quality and project organization.

## Quick Start

1. **Start Here**: [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started)
2. **Architecture**: [Document-Driven Architecture](./architecture/overview)
3. **Best Practices**: [AI Coding Best Practices](./best-practices/coding)
4. **Examples**: [Code Examples](./examples/code)
5. **Debugging**: [Debugging Techniques](./debugging/techniques)

## Documentation Structure

### Core Sections

- **[Architecture](./architecture/)** - System architecture and design patterns
- **[Best Practices](./best-practices/)** - AI coding and project management practices
- **[Examples](./examples/)** - Practical code examples and implementations
- **[Debugging](./debugging/)** - Debugging techniques and troubleshooting
- **[Security](./security/)** - Security best practices and guidelines
- **[Learning](./learning/)** - Learning paths and resources

### Key Features

- **AI-Optimized Content**: Designed specifically for AI agent consumption
- **Document-Driven**: All documentation follows document-driven architecture principles
- **Version-Controlled**: All documentation is version-controlled and tracked
- **Interactive Examples**: Live code examples and demonstrations
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: From basic concepts to advanced techniques

## Target Audience

This documentation is designed for:

- **AI Coding Agents**: Primary target audience
- **AI Developers**: Building AI-powered development tools

- **Best Practices**: Review the [best practices section](./best-practices/coding)
- **Examples**: Browse the [examples section](./examples/code)
- **Architecture Questions**: See the [architecture overview](./architecture/overview)

## Contributing

This documentation follows the same document-driven architecture principles it describes. All changes should be:

1. **Project-Based**: Associated with a specific project
2. **Version-Controlled**: Properly versioned and tracked
3. **Well-Documented**: Clear documentation of changes
4. **Tested**: Validated and tested before integration

## Version Information
