# Project Management System

## Overview
Comprehensive project management system with version-controlled development, plan analysis, and automated commit integration.

## File Naming Convention

### Version-First Naming
```
Format: {project-type}-{project-name}-v{major}.{minor}.{patch}.md

Examples:
- feature-user-auth-v1.0.0.md
- refactor-mcp-market-v2.1.0.md
- bugfix-login-flow-v1.0.1.md
- documentation-api-guide-v1.0.0.md
```

### Project Types
- **feature**: New feature development
- **refactor**: Code refactoring and restructuring
- **bugfix**: Bug fixes and issue resolution
- **documentation**: Documentation updates and creation
- **infrastructure**: Infrastructure and tooling improvements

## Version Control

### Semantic Versioning
- **Major (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes, major architectural changes
- **Minor (1.X.0)**: New features, significant enhancements
- **Patch (1.0.X)**: Bug fixes, minor improvements

### Version Progression
- **v1.0.0**: Initial release and foundation
- **v1.1.0**: Feature additions and enhancements
- **v1.2.0**: Additional features and improvements
- **v2.0.0**: Major architectural changes or breaking changes

## Project Lifecycle

### 3. Design Phase
- Technical design and specification
- Architecture decisions
- Interface design
- Implementation strategy

### 4. Implementation Phase
- Active development
- Regular commits and progress tracking
- Quality assurance
- Integration testing

### 5. Testing Phase
- Comprehensive testing
- Performance validation
- Security testing
- User acceptance testing

### 6. Review Phase
- Code review and refinement
- Documentation review
- Stakeholder review
- Final validation

### 7. Deployment Phase
- Release preparation
- Deployment execution
- Monitoring and validation
- Rollback planning

### 8. Completion Phase
- Post-deployment monitoring
- Lessons learned
- Documentation finalization
- Project retrospective

## Commit Integration

### Commit Message Format
```
{type}({project}): {description} [v{major}.{minor}.{patch}]

{detailed-description}

- Files changed: {count} files
- Lines added: {count} lines
- Lines removed: {count} lines
- Tasks completed: {completed}/{total}
- Blockers resolved: {count} blockers
- Next phase: {next-phase}
```

### Commit Types
- **phase**: Project phase completion
- **milestone**: Milestone achievement
- **feat**: New feature implementation
- **fix**: Bug fix or blocker resolution
- **refactor**: Code refactoring
- **docs**: Documentation updates
- **test**: Testing implementation
- **daily**: Daily progress updates
- **complete**: Project completion

### Automated Triggers
- **Pre-commit**: Project context validation
- **Post-commit**: Progress tracking and metrics update
- **Phase completion**: Automatic phase commits
- **Milestone achievement**: Milestone commits

## Plan Analysis

### Analysis Components
- **Scope Analysis**: Project boundaries and dependencies
- **Risk Assessment**: Technical and timeline risks
- **Resource Planning**: Team, time, and budget allocation
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing and validation strategies
- **Version Planning**: Release and compatibility planning

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Scope clearly defined and bounded
- [ ] Dependencies identified and validated
- [ ] Resource requirements realistic and available
- [ ] Timeline achievable with appropriate buffers
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies in place
- [ ] Quality criteria measurable and testable
- [ ] Version strategy defined and communicated

## Status Reporting

### Enhanced Status Report Format
```
**Status Report**
- Project: {name} [v{major}.{minor}.{patch}]

- Phase: {current-phase}
- Files Changed: {count} files
- Tasks: {completed}/{total}

- Commits: {count} this phase
- Next: {next-immediate-action}
- Version: {next-version}
```

### Metrics Tracking
- Task completion percentage
- Blocker count and priority
- Estimated vs actual time
- File change count
- Commit frequency
- Version progression
- Plan adherence percentage

## Quality Assurance

### Project Validation
- All projects must have complete metadata
- Version numbers must follow semantic versioning
- File names must follow version-first convention
- Progress logs must be updated regularly
- Commits must reference project versions

### Code Quality Integration
- All code changes must align with project goals
- Acceptance criteria must be validated
- Project constraints must be respected
- Architectural decisions must be documented
- Performance impact must be assessed

## Automation Integration

### Git Hooks
- **Pre-commit**: Validate project context and commit message format
- **Post-commit**: Update project progress and metrics
- **Pre-push**: Validate project completeness
- **Post-merge**: Update project dependencies

### CI/CD Integration
- **Build triggers**: Automatic builds on phase and milestone commits
- **Test execution**: Automated testing on feature commits
- **Deployment triggers**: Deployment on project completion commits
- **Quality gates**: Quality checks on all commit types

## Best Practices

### Project Creation
- Always check for existing projects before creating new ones
- Use appropriate project type and naming convention
- Include complete metadata and context
- Define clear acceptance criteria and success metrics

### Development Workflow
- Work within project scope and constraints
- Update progress logs regularly
- Commit frequently with proper message format
- Document decisions and rationale

### Version Management
- Use semantic versioning consistently
- Increment versions appropriately
- Maintain version history and documentation
- Plan version progression and compatibility

### Plan Analysis
- Analyze plans thoroughly before implementation
- Validate assumptions and dependencies
- Assess risks and mitigation strategies
- Optimize plans for efficiency and quality
