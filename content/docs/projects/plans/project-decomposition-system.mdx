# Project Decomposition System Design

## Overview
A system to automatically identify when projects can be broken into smaller, parallel work streams to enable "whomever picks it up first" parallel development.

## Core Requirements
1. **Parallel Work Detection**: Identify independent tasks that can be worked on simultaneously
2. **Dependency Management**: Maintain clear dependency relationships between decomposed projects
3. **Agent Assignment**: Enable multiple agents to pick up different parts independently
4. **Progress Tracking**: Track progress across decomposed project streams
5. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate decomposed work back into main project

## Decomposition Detection Algorithm

### Project Analysis Criteria

#### Size-Based Detection
Projects are candidates for decomposition if they meet size criteria:
- **Task Count**: 10+ tasks in current stage
- **Estimated Hours**: 40+ hours of work
- **File Count**: 15+ files to be modified
- **Complexity Score**: High complexity based on multiple factors

#### Independence Analysis
Tasks are candidates for parallel work if they:
- **No Dependencies**: Don't depend on other tasks in the project
- **Different Domains**: Work on different parts of the system
- **Different File Sets**: Modify different sets of files
- **Different Skills**: Require different technical skills

#### Decomposition Patterns

##### By Domain/Module
- **Frontend/Backend**: Separate UI and API work
- **Feature/Infrastructure**: Separate feature work from supporting infrastructure
- **Core/Integration**: Separate core functionality from integrations
- **Data/Logic**: Separate data handling from business logic

##### By Task Type
- **Code/Documentation**: Separate implementation from documentation
- **Implementation/Testing**: Separate development from testing
- **Core/Configuration**: Separate core features from configuration
- **New/Refactor**: Separate new features from refactoring

##### By Dependencies
- **Independent Streams**: Tasks with no interdependencies
- **Sequential Streams**: Tasks that can be done in parallel but integrated sequentially
- **Optional Streams**: Tasks that are nice-to-have and can be done independently

### Decomposition Process

1. **Project Analysis**
   - Analyze current project scope and tasks
   - Identify size and complexity indicators
   - Map task dependencies and relationships

2. **Independence Detection**
   - Identify tasks with no dependencies
   - Group tasks by domain/module
   - Identify different skill requirements

3. **Decomposition Strategy**
   - Choose appropriate decomposition pattern
   - Create parallel work streams
   - Define integration points

4. **Sub-Project Creation**
   - Create new project documents for each stream
   - Define clear scope and deliverables
   - Establish dependency relationships

5. **Agent Assignment**
   - Make sub-projects available for agent pickup
   - Provide clear handoff documentation
   - Enable parallel development

## Decomposition Patterns

### Pattern 1: Domain Separation
**Use Case**: Large feature with frontend and backend components

**Example**: User Authentication System
- **Main Project**: `feature-user-auth-v1.0.0` (nickname: "Guardian-Gate")
- **Sub-Project 1**: `feature-user-auth-frontend-v1.0.0` (nickname: "Swift-Interface")
- **Sub-Project 2**: `feature-user-auth-backend-v1.0.0` (nickname: "Secure-Vault")

**Dependencies**: Frontend depends on backend API completion

### Pattern 2: Feature/Infrastructure Separation
**Use Case**: New feature requiring supporting infrastructure

**Example**: Real-time Chat Feature
- **Main Project**: `feature-realtime-chat-v1.0.0` (nickname: "Live-Stream")
- **Sub-Project 1**: `infrastructure-websocket-support-v1.0.0` (nickname: "Bridge-Builder")
- **Sub-Project 2**: `feature-chat-ui-components-v1.0.0` (nickname: "Chat-Bubble")

**Dependencies**: Chat UI depends on WebSocket infrastructure

### Pattern 3: Implementation/Testing Separation
**Use Case**: Large implementation with comprehensive testing

**Example**: Payment Processing System
- **Main Project**: `feature-payment-system-v1.0.0` (nickname: "Treasure-Keeper")
- **Sub-Project 1**: `feature-payment-implementation-v1.0.0` (nickname: "Coin-Processor")
- **Sub-Project 2**: `feature-payment-testing-v1.0.0` (nickname: "Quality-Guard")

**Dependencies**: Testing depends on implementation completion

### Pattern 4: Core/Integration Separation
**Use Case**: Core feature with multiple integrations

**Example**: Data Export System
- **Main Project**: `feature-data-export-v1.0.0` (nickname: "Data-Porter")
- **Sub-Project 1**: `feature-export-core-v1.0.0` (nickname: "Export-Engine")
- **Sub-Project 2**: `feature-export-integrations-v1.0.0` (nickname: "Bridge-Master")

**Dependencies**: Integrations depend on core export functionality

## Sub-Project Management

### Sub-Project Structure
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "projectId": "feature-user-auth-frontend-v1.0.0",
    "title": "User Authentication Frontend Components",
    "parentProject": "feature-user-auth-v1.0.0",
    "decompositionType": "domain-separation",
    "nickname": "Swift-Interface",
    "stage": "implementation"
  },
  "decomposition": {
    "parentProjectId": "feature-user-auth-v1.0.0",
    "decompositionType": "domain-separation",
    "dependencyType": "depends-on",
    "dependsOn": ["feature-user-auth-backend-v1.0.0"],
    "blocks": [],
    "integrationPoints": ["api-endpoints", "authentication-flow"]
  }
}
```

### Dependency Management
- **Parent-Child Relationship**: Clear parent project identification
- **Sibling Dependencies**: Dependencies between sub-projects
- **Integration Points**: Defined points where work integrates
- **Blocking Relationships**: Which sub-projects block others

### Progress Tracking
- **Individual Progress**: Track progress of each sub-project
- **Overall Progress**: Aggregate progress across all sub-projects
- **Dependency Status**: Track dependency completion
- **Integration Status**: Track integration progress

## Agent Assignment System

### "Whomever Picks It Up First" Model
- **Available Projects**: List of sub-projects ready for work
- **Agent Selection**: First available agent picks up project
- **Handoff Documentation**: Clear context for new agent
- **Progress Updates**: Regular updates to parent project

### Agent Handoff Process
1. **Project Selection**: Agent selects available sub-project
2. **Context Loading**: Load parent project context and dependencies
3. **Work Execution**: Complete sub-project tasks
4. **Progress Reporting**: Update parent project with progress
5. **Integration**: Coordinate with other sub-projects for integration

### Handoff Documentation
```json
{
  "handoffNotes": {
    "parentContext": "Main project context and goals",
    "subProjectScope": "Specific scope of this sub-project",
    "dependencies": "What this sub-project depends on",
    "deliverables": "Expected deliverables",
    "integrationPoints": "How this integrates with other sub-projects",
    "successCriteria": "How to know when this sub-project is complete"
  }
}
```

## Integration and Completion

### Integration Process
1. **Dependency Completion**: Wait for all dependencies to complete
2. **Integration Testing**: Test integration between sub-projects
3. **Parent Project Update**: Update parent project with completed work
4. **Progress Aggregation**: Aggregate progress across all sub-projects

### Completion Criteria
- **Individual Completion**: Each sub-project meets its success criteria
- **Integration Success**: All sub-projects integrate successfully
- **Parent Project Goals**: Parent project goals are achieved
- **Quality Validation**: Overall quality meets project standards

### Rollback and Recovery
- **Individual Rollback**: Rollback individual sub-projects if needed
- **Dependency Rollback**: Handle rollback of dependencies
- **Parent Project Recovery**: Recover parent project state
- **Alternative Approaches**: Implement alternative solutions

## Quality Assurance

### Decomposition Quality Criteria
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each sub-project has clear, well-defined scope
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Sub-projects have minimal interdependencies
- **Parallel Potential**: Sub-projects can be worked on in parallel
- **Integration Clarity**: Clear integration points and processes
- **Progress Visibility**: Clear progress tracking across all streams

### Validation Rules
- **Size Threshold**: Only decompose projects above size threshold
- **Independence Check**: Verify sub-projects can work independently
- **Dependency Validation**: Ensure dependencies are clearly defined
- **Integration Testing**: Validate integration points work correctly
- **Progress Tracking**: Ensure progress can be tracked effectively

### Testing Strategy
- **Decomposition Detection**: Test detection algorithm on sample projects
- **Sub-Project Creation**: Test sub-project creation process

- **Agent Assignment**: Test agent pickup and handoff process

## Implementation Details

### Decomposition Detection Algorithm
```javascript
function analyzeProjectForDecomposition(project) {
  const analysis = {
    shouldDecompose: false,
    decompositionType: null,
    subProjects: [],
    dependencies: []
  };
  
  // Size analysis
  const sizeScore = calculateSizeScore(project);
  if (sizeScore < DECOMPOSITION_THRESHOLD) {
    return analysis;
  }
  
  // Independence analysis
  const independentTasks = findIndependentTasks(project);
  if (independentTasks.length < MIN_PARALLEL_TASKS) {
    return analysis;
  }
  
  // Decomposition pattern selection
  const pattern = selectDecompositionPattern(project, independentTasks);
  analysis.shouldDecompose = true;
  analysis.decompositionType = pattern.type;
  analysis.subProjects = pattern.subProjects;
  analysis.dependencies = pattern.dependencies;
  
  return analysis;
}
```

### Sub-Project Creation
```javascript
function createSubProject(parentProject, subProjectSpec) {
  const subProject = {
    ...parentProject,
    metadata: {
      ...parentProject.metadata,
      projectId: subProjectSpec.id,
      title: subProjectSpec.title,
      parentProject: parentProject.metadata.projectId,
      decompositionType: subProjectSpec.decompositionType,
      nickname: generateNickname(subProjectSpec)
    },
    decomposition: {
      parentProjectId: parentProject.metadata.projectId,
      decompositionType: subProjectSpec.decompositionType,
      dependencyType: subProjectSpec.dependencyType,
      dependsOn: subProjectSpec.dependsOn,
      blocks: subProjectSpec.blocks,
      integrationPoints: subProjectSpec.integrationPoints
    },
    currentStage: {
      ...parentProject.currentStage,
      tasks: subProjectSpec.tasks
    }
  };
  
  return subProject;
}
```
