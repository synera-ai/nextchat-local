## Human Context

### Problem Statement
The current project management system relies heavily on manual documentation and lacks automated integration with the development workflow. We need to implement a document-driven architecture that automatically generates, updates, and maintains project documentation based on code changes, commits, and development activities.

### Business Value
- **Automated Documentation**: Documentation automatically stays in sync with code
- **Reduced Manual Work**: Less manual effort required for project documentation
- **Better Traceability**: Clear traceability between code changes and project progress
- **Improved Accuracy**: Documentation accuracy improved through automation
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Better collaboration between human developers and AI agents

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Document generation from code changes and commits
- [ ] Automatic project progress tracking from development activities
- [ ] Integration with existing project management system
- [ ] Real-time documentation updates
- [ ] Automated status reporting and metrics
- [ ] Seamless integration with development workflow

### Constraints
- Must integrate with existing project management system
- Should not disrupt existing development workflow
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing documentation
- Should consider performance implications of automation

### Stakeholders
- **Development Team**: Need automated documentation that doesn't interfere with workflow
