**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive user guide with clear navigation
- Visual system architecture diagrams
- Step-by-step getting started guide
- Complete prompt reference for human users
- Workflow documentation for common patterns

## Notes

This analysis reveals a significant gap between the comprehensive project management system described in documentation and the actual implementation in the codebase. While the documentation is well-structured and comprehensive, the lack of implementation creates a disconnect that limits the system's effectiveness.

The recommendations focus on bridging this gap by implementing the core functionality described in the documentation, ensuring that the system works as intended and provides value to both human developers and AI agents.
