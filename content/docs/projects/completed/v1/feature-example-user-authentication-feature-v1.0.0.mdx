## Human Context

### Problem Statement
The application currently lacks user authentication, which limits its functionality and prevents user-specific features. Users cannot save their preferences, access personalized content, or maintain session state across browser sessions.

### Business Value
- **User Engagement**: Users can create accounts and maintain persistent sessions
- **Personalization**: Enable user-specific features and preferences
- **Data Security**: Protect user data with proper authentication
- **Scalability**: Foundation for future user-centric features

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can register new accounts with email/password
- [ ] Users can log in and log out securely
- [ ] Session persistence across browser sessions
- [ ] Password reset functionality
- [ ] Secure password storage with hashing
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities in authentication flow

### Constraints
- Must integrate with existing NextChat architecture
- Should use existing UI components and styling

## Progress Log

- **2025-01-15** - **Human Developer**: Created initial project document and defined requirements
  - Stage: idea
  - Files Changed: []
- **2025-01-15** - **research-agent**: Authentication research and planning completed
  - Stage: plan
  - Files Changed: [`.//docs/projects-guide/user-authentication-research.md`]
  - **Completed Work**: 
    - Comprehensive research on authentication patterns (JWT, Session-based, OAuth)
    - Security best practices analysis and recommendations
    - Database schema design with users and refresh_tokens tables
    - API endpoint specification with 8 authentication endpoints
    - Implementation strategy with technology stack recommendations
    - Security considerations and testing strategy
  - **Next Steps**: [Ready for implementation phase]
  - **Important Notes**: [JWT with refresh tokens recommended as optimal approach]

## Decisions

- **2025-01-15** - **Decision**: Use JWT for authentication tokens
  - **Rationale**: JWT provides stateless authentication suitable for distributed systems
  - **Impact**: Affects API design and client-side token handling
  - **Alternatives**: Session-based authentication, OAuth
  - **Made By**: Human Developer

## Blockers

- **BLOCKER-001**: Need to decide on password hashing library
  - Status: resolved
  - Priority: medium
  - Assigned To: security-agent
  - Created: 2025-01-15
  - Resolved: 2025-01-15
  - Impact: bcrypt selected as password hashing library

## Feature-Specific Sections

### User Stories
- As a new user, I want to create an account so that I can access personalized features
- As an existing user, I want to log in so that I can access my saved data
- As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access if I forget it
- As a user, I want to log out so that I can secure my session on shared devices

### UI/UX Considerations
- Clean, simple login/registration forms
- Clear error messages for validation failures
- Loading states during authentication
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)

### API Design
- **Endpoint**: `/api/auth/register`
  - Method: POST
  - Description: Register a new user account
  - Request: `{ email: string, password: string, name: string }`
  - Response: `{ success: boolean, message: string, user?: User }`

- **Endpoint**: `/api/auth/login`
  - Method: POST
  - Description: Authenticate user and return JWT token
  - Request: `{ email: string, password: string }`
  - Response: `{ success: boolean, token?: string, user?: User }`

- **Endpoint**: `/api/auth/logout`
  - Method: POST
  - Description: Invalidate user session
  - Request: `{ token: string }`
  - Response: `{ success: boolean, message: string }`

### Database Changes
- Table: `users`
  - Changes: Create new table with fields: id, email, password_hash, name, created_at, updated_at
  - Migration: Add user table migration script

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Test authentication functions and utilities
- Integration tests: Test API endpoints with database
- E2E tests: Test complete authentication flows
- Security tests: Test for common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS)

### Performance Considerations
- Password hashing should not block request processing
- JWT validation should be fast
- Database queries should be optimized
- Consider rate limiting for authentication endpoints

### Security Considerations
- Passwords must be hashed with bcrypt (minimum 12 rounds)
- JWT tokens must be signed with secure secret
- Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Use HTTPS for all authentication requests
- Implement proper session timeout

### Deployment Notes
- Environment variables needed: JWT_SECRET, DATABASE_URL
- Database migration required for users table
- No feature flags needed (core functionality)
- Consider gradual rollout for user registration

### Rollback Plan
- Remove authentication endpoints
- Disable authentication middleware
- Remove user registration UI
- Database rollback script for users table
- Communication plan for existing users

## Next Steps

1. **Research Phase**: Complete security research and pattern analysis
2. **Design Phase**: Finalize database schema and API design
3. **Implementation Phase**: Begin with backend authentication logic
4. **Testing Phase**: Implement comprehensive test suite
5. **Integration Phase**: Connect frontend with authentication APIs
6. **Deployment Phase**: Deploy with proper monitoring and rollback plan
