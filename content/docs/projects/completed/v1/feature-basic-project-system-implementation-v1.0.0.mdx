## Human Context

### Problem Statement
The comprehensive project management system described in documentation is not implemented in the codebase, creating a significant gap between documentation and actual functionality. We need to implement basic project management functionality to bridge this gap and make the system work as intended.

### Business Value

- **AI Agent Effectiveness**: Provide AI agents with proper project management context
- **Developer Experience**: Enable developers to use the project management system
- **System Validation**: Validate that the documented system can work in practice
- **Foundation for Growth**: Create foundation for advanced project management features

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Basic project detection and context loading implemented
- [ ] Minimal project management functionality in codebase
- [ ] Integration with development workflow
- [ ] Automated validation of project compliance
- [ ] Status reporting integration
- [ ] Commit message formatting enforcement

### Constraints
- Must implement core functionality described in documentation
- Should not break existing development workflow
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Should be minimal viable implementation

### Stakeholders
